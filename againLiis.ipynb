    "## Project Goals\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze data from National Park Service about various species around different national park locations. \n",
    "This project will analyze, prepare, plot data and try to explain the findings of the analysis. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks.\n",
    "Here are a few questions that this project is trying to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    " - What category of species is the most likely to be endangered?\n",
    " - Which category of species is the most observed?\n",
    " - What animal is the most common and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",

    "**Data Sources:**\n",

    " - What category of species is the most likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    - `Mammal` is the most likely animal to be endangered and also the most likely animal to be under protection, with `Birds`being runner ups.\n",
    " - Which category of species is the most observed?\n",
    "    - The `category` of species that is most observed is **Vascular Plant** with **Birds** being runner ups again.\n",

    "This dataset only included observations from the last 7 days which prohibits analyze changes over time. It would be curious to see how the conservation status for various species changes over time. Another piece that is missing is the Area of each park, it can be assumed that Yellowstone National Park might be much larger than the other parks which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater biodiversity. Lastly, if precise locations were recorded, the spatial distribution of the species could also be observed and test if these observations are spatially clustered."

    "After finishing this project, I would give myself maybe a 4-5 points out of 10 for this project. I would say I got a lot of help from other people who have already done this project and a lot of code is from them. I didn't have many ideas for this project myself and I didn't think much out of the box so I feel like this is a weaker project of mine. I think if I was more interested in the data, I would have focused on it more. I am somewhat proud of what I wrote here but I also took a lot of inspiration from other's work. I can come back to this and see what I did and understand what I did but it's just not that beautiful as I wish it was. I'd say I learned quite a bit on this project and hopefully I will be better at my next project. The biggest issue I had and didn't do is cleaning the data fully, as I assumed that they gave me a clean dataset. \n",
